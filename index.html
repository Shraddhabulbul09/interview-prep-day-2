       <h3>Q1. What is an event loop and call stack</h3>
       <p>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser)
        to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently
        being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc. or we can say that it
        stores global execution context and function execution context.
        </p>
        
        <p>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the
            call stack. All the web apis functions like setTimeout, setInterval, fetch calls etc. will not be
            directly executed inside the execution context, firstly they will be moved to callback queue and
            then the moment call stack gets empty these functions will be pushed to call stack from
            callback queue by event loop. If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function
            from the callback queue to the call stack. If the callback queue is empty, nothing will happen</p>
       <h3>Q2. What is creation phase and execution phase?</h3>
       <p>Creation Phase 
         In the first run, It picks all function declarations and stores them in memory with
        their reference.
        In the second run, It picks all variables and assign undefined to them. In the event of
        a conflict between variable and function declaration name then that variable is
        ignored.
        </p>
        
        <p>Execution Phase 
             Variables assigned with values given in code at the time of initialization.
             Functions executed
            </p>
       <h3>Q3. What is the spread operator?</h3>
       <p>Ans:- In JS spread opreatores(...) is allows us to destructure the non-primitive data types like Arrays and Objects to access the elements individually.</p>
       <pre>
        const Obj1 = {
            name : "Tokyo",
            age : 25
        }
        
        const Obj2 = {
            Course : "MERN",
            ...Obj1
        }
        
        console.log(Obj1);
        console.log(Obj2);</pre>

        <h3>Q4. What is the use of setTimeout</h3>
        <p>Ans:- The setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.
        </p>
        <pre>function Display(){
            let time = new Date();
          let hr = time.toLocaleTimeString();
          console.log(hr);
    
          setTimeout(()=>{
            Display();
          },1000)
    }
    Display();</pre>

    <h3>Q5. What are callbacks?</h3>
    <p>Ans:- A callback is a function that passed as an argument to another function.
    </p>
    <pre>function greet (name, callback){
        console.log(`Hii ${name}`);
        callback();
    }
    function callMe(){
        console.log(" I am a callback function");
    }
    
    greet('peter',callMe) </pre>

    <h3>Q6. What is callback hell</h3>
    <p> Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure.</p>
    <pre>
        function demo(callback){
            console.log("step 1");
            callback();
        }
        function demo2(callback){
            console.log("step 2");
            callback();
        }
        function demo3(callback){
            console.log("step 3");
            callback();
        }
        function demo4(callback){
            console.log("step 4");
            callback();
        }
        function demo5(){
            console.log("step 5");
        }
        
        demo(function(){
            demo2(function(){
                demo3(function(){
                    demo4(function(){
                        demo5();
                    })
                })
            })
        })</pre>

    <h3>Q7. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
    <pre>
        1. undefine - variable dec. but not init.
        2. not define - variable is not declear.
        3. NaN - Not a Number
